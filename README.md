#  Shooter Game.
 
> In this project, I created a web application using JS and Phaser3 framework for a simple shooter game.


- My Objectives at this project to create a simple and easy to use shooter game with basic functions:
    1. Basic and attractive game design.
    2. Basic options that meet the requirements of this game.
    3. Adding score options for the players who want to show up their scores.



# How to play?

1. Firstly you will see the loading scene:

4. Controll buttons: 
    - W for up.
    - S for down.
    - A for left.
    - D for right.
    - Space for fire.
